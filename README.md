For project 3 we are going to create a program to create a version of Rock-Paper-Scissors
where the user plays the computer. But I want your program to cheat – yes, cheat. Normally in a Rock-PaperScissors
program the user would select Rock, Paper or Scissors and then the computer would select one randomly.
But I want your program to let the user select one and the have the computer select the one that wins. So, if the
user selects Rock, the computer should select Paper.
First ask the user how many games they want to play. This should be an odd number. If the user doesn’t enter an
odd number, give them an error and make them re-enter it. Then play Rock-Paper-Scissors that number of times.
At the end of the program should say who won a majority of the matches.

This program makes use of:
* Print functions
* Variables 
* Print function optional arguments
* Eval input fuctions
* If/else statements
* Functions
* String formatting operations
* Importing functions
* While loops
* Comparison operations
* Range functions
